Struck off charge 30/3/1960 upon transfer to Short Brothers &amp; Harland at Belfast for conversion to a Canberra U.14 as part of the drone conversion programme.  <br/> <br/>The Fleet Air Arm's association with the English Electric Canberra began in quiet fashion in May 1961. Six surplus Canberra B.2 air frames from the Royal Air Force were moved to Short Brothers' airfield at Belfast in 1960 for conversion to U.14 specification. This would allow them to be operated by radio control on the ground without the need for a pilot in the cockpit. The first aeroplane delivered to the Fleet Air Arm was Canberra was WH921, when it arrived at RNAS Hal Far in Malta ready for service with 728B NAS (Navy Air Squadron) on 25th May 1961. The fleet code '590' was applied, and gradually the remaining five aeroplanes arrived from Belfast to join the Squadron and were coded in-sequence; WD941/591, WH720/592, WJ638/593, WH704/594 and WH876/595. All were painted overall white, with wide black bands on the outer wings. <br/> <br/>During August 1961, WH720/593 completed the first U.14 pilot-less flight in Fleet Air Arm service, and 728 NAS began an intensive period of flying on guided missile trials involving the Armstrong Whitworth Seaslug weapon, the Canberras being operating alongside the Unit's existing fleet of Gloster Meteor U.15 and U.16s and Fairey Firefly U.9s.  <br/> <br/>On 6th October 1961, ERROR was shot down by a missile fired from the Royal Navy warship HMS Girdle Ness, and the trials continued until the end of the test programme on 5th December 1961. WH921 was thus the first Canberra to see FAA service, the first to be delivered to 728B Squadron, and also the first and last to be shot down by a Seaslug missile.",,,

The aircraft was registered to and operated by Raytheon Missile Systems Advanced Programs of Tucson, Arizona.  There were no injuries to persons on the ground.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 test flight, and no flight plan was filed.  The aircraft had departed from a paved airstrip at the Unmanned Vehicles International (UVI), Incorporated facility near Whetstone, Arizona, at approximately 0809.  <br/> <br/>The purpose of the flight was to test a photo-mapping package for the U. S. Army Corp of Engineers. The Cobra UAS was to serve as an aerial platform for the device.  The test consisted of the aircraft performing an automatic takeoff and climb to 1,000 feet above ground level (agl), fly a programming leg on which the internal mapping system would align, and then enter a grid series of 17 parallel, 5 mile long north-to-south, south-to-north legs that progressed west to east along which the camera would photograph and record the terrain over which it was being flown.  Following the mapping legs. The aircraft then was to descend to pattern altitude and enter a non-standard traffic pattern from which it would execute an automatic landing. <br/> <br/>The aircraft was computer controlled through software that established altitudes, airspeeds and GPS waypoints for the aircraft to fly.  Commands to the vehicle were sent via omni radio and executed by an internal pilot that sat at a control console located in the back of a company half-ton truck.  For this flight, a Raytheon internal pilot was instructing a U. S. Army student pilot, who manned the computer console, monitored the wing camera display, and held the remote control box in case it was needed.  Other persons associated with the vehicle operation were a Test Director, a company observer, a company crew chief and a U. S. Army crew chief in training.  All of these persons were in radio communication with the internal pilots in the truck.   <br/> <br/>The aircraft underwent preflight and systems tests.  The aircraft's engine was started at 0805 and the aircraft's left wing-mounted camera was activated.  Following automatic and manual engine run ups, the aircraft was taxied to a position on the UVI runway at which time the student pilot entered the command for an automatic takeoff.  The aircraft took off to the south and climbed to 5,200 feet msl (1,000 feet agl), and began its programmed mission.  <br/> <br/>Following the final pass, the aircraft was to enter a single figure-eight pattern that was to set it up for landing.  During the turn from north to east, the aircraft engine lost all power.  The autopilot then commanded the aircraft to descend to hold airspeed and maintain it's ground track profile.  An observer watching the aircraft from the ground queried the internal pilot at the command station regarding the aircraft's continuing descent.  The internal pilot then noted the red-highlighted warning on the console indicating the engine RPMs were at zero.  The autopilot executed a turn to the south, which aligned the aircraft with the runway at an altitude approximately 800 feet above the ground.  The internal pilot told the student pilot at the console to input the ""Land Now"" command.  The student pilot switched the remote control box to ""manual"" instead and the aircraft pitched down approximately 45 degrees and descended rapidly. The Test Director, who was also watching from the ground, radioed the command to ""pull up.""  In the wing camera monitor, the runway was visible and coming up fast. <br/> <br/>During approximately 30 minutes of the flight, the aircraft's engine was operated at a high constant power setting of 5,300 RPM. An examination of the engine showed that one of the pistons overheated, expanded and rubbed against the cylinder wall, stopping the engine. The needle valves on the carburetor were set at a very lean fuel mixture which would contribute to the damaged piston. An examination of the autopilot software showed that during the attempt to put the vehicle into automatic landing mode, an improper command was sent by the operators. <br/> <br/> <br/>The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident as follows: <br/>A total off of engine power resulting from an overheated piston, and the pilot's subsequent failure to send a proper command to the UAS. Contributing to the accident was the operation of the engine at high power for an extended period with a lean fuel setting.",,,

The crash site was remote desert terrain close to the FOB, so US Army Soldiers were able to retrieve the salvageable MRPA. The MRPA was intact, but the wings were cut off by the Soldiers retrieving it in order to fit it on their vehicles and return it to their FOB. There were no injuries and there was no damage to other government or private property. <br/>After normal maintenance and pre-flight checks, the MRPA taxied and departed from Jalalabad Air Base at approximately 2250Z on 30 Apr 2011. At 1500Z on 1 May 11, the mishap crew (MC) was working with ground forces in Afghanistan when they encountered weather that prevented them staying on station. <br/>The MC coordinated with air traffic control to work another operating area and encountered deteriorating weather conditions and severe clear icing on the MRPA. The MC altered course to get out of the weather and icing conditions. During this transit time the MC received numerous indications of maintenance anomalies (high turbo oil temperature, oil pressure and manifold pressure) for the MRPA. The MC attempted to alleviate the high turbo oil temperature by running the appropriate emergency checklists.  <br/>The MC utilized the necessary emergency checklists but the high turbo oil temperature indications continued and the MRPA started an insidious descent rate of 200 to 400 feet per minute. The MRPA never maintained level flight again and crashed in a remote area of Afghanistan at approximately 1650Z. <br/>The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President determined by clear and convincing evidence that the cause of the mishap was due to prop thrust bearing failure. The failure of the prop thrust bearing contaminated the oil system with metal shavings and particulate that clogged the oil filter, resulting in a lack of adequate oil to the turbocharger and engine. Due to the lack of oil flowing through the system, the MRPA turbocharger eventually failed as well. The MRPA engine was unable to produce adequate thrust with a failed turbocharger and began to descend at a rate of 200 to 400 feet per minute. The MRPA engine developed oil pressure and manifold pressure (MAP) indications that were abnormal due to the oil system contamination. Eventually the MRPA engine experienced excessive heat damage and deterioration which caused a cylinder skirt to crack and destroyed connecting rod #2 further limiting the ability of the MRPA to maintain level flight. The MC realized the MRPA could not return to base or fly <br/>to an emergency divert, so the MC controlled the MRPA away from known populated areas. The MRPA crashed when it impacted the terrain. The estimated loss is valued at $2.02M.",,,

	 ", Approach,Military,,,"On 6 May 2017, at about 22:38 Zulu Time (Z), the mishap aircraft (MA), an MQ-9A, tail number 12-4175, assigned to the 432d Wing (432 WG), and operated by the 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron (361 ERS), 332d Air Expeditionary Wing (332 AEW), crashed in the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility after MA handover from the Mission Control Element (MCE) to the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE). The MA was destroyed following impact with terrain and no wreckage was recovered.  <br/> <br/>At about 2003Z, the LRE mishap crew (MC) gained control of the MA. The MC consisted of the mishap pilot (MP), the mishap instructor pilot, and the mishap sensor operator. After handover, the MC ran through standard checklists. In accordance with the checklists, the MP updated the emergency mission (EM) start point and attempted to send the EM to the MA. The MP elected to power down the Interim Modem Assembly (IMA) before landing, which severed the MA¬ís link to the MCE. At about 2025Z, the Ground Control Station lost downlink from the MA on final approach to the airfield due to interference by another MQ-9A transmitting on high power on the ground. As a result, the MC lost situational awareness of the MA. <br/>Approximately one minute after the loss of downlink, the MC terminated uplink in accordance with emergency procedures, which caused the MA to execute its EM. The MP¬ís attempt to send the LRE EM to the MA, as required after handover, was unsuccessful. Therefore, the MA executed the last EM received from the MCE. In accordance with the MCE EM, the MA flew away from the airfield with its downlink transmitters disabled. Despite efforts, neither the LRE nor MCE could recover link to the MA. The MCE crew did not delete any EM waypoints before handover to LRE. As a result, the MA had insufficient fuel to fly through all EM waypoints before returning to the LRE airfield. The MA crashed while executing the MCE EM two hours and 13 minutes after losing downlink. <br/> <br/>The Abbreviated Accident Investigation (AAIB) President found by a preponderance of the evidence that the causes of the mishap were: (1) the unintentional downlink interference from a ground-based MQ-9A transmitting on high power, and (2) the failure to successfully send an LRE EM to the MA after handover from the MCE. The AAIB President found by a preponderance of the evidence that factors that substantially contributed to the mishap were: (1) the LRE practice of disabling the IMA before landing, and (2) the MCE practice of not deleting EM waypoints before LRE handover.

Both Iranian and Hezbollah forces have been backing Syrian President Bashar Assad in the Syrian civil war. <br/> <br/>Israel has warned that it will not accept a permanent presence of Iran or its allied militias near its border in postwar Syria. Israel says that it expects any agreement ending the war in Syria to include a 20-kilometre (12-mile) buffer zone meant to keep away Iranian-backed militants. Israel has been closely watching Iran's involvement in the war in neighbouring Syria. It fears Iran could use Syrian territory to stage attacks on Israel, or create a land corridor from Iran to Lebanon that could allow it to transfer weapons more easily to Hezbollah. <br/> <br/>Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel viewed Saturday's drone incident gravely and would respond to any provocation: ""We hold the Syrian regime responsible for any firing or breach of sovereignty and call on it to hold back all players active in its territory,"" Lieberman said in a statement.

Assigned to the 432d Wing, Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, the MQ-9A was operated by the 62d Expeditionary Attack Squadron Launch and Recovery Element in the deployed environment at the time of the mishap. The aircraft was destroyed. <br/>Approximately 20 minutes after a successful launch, the mishap crew (MC) discovered an oil level and pressure warning; the oil was at 76 percent and dropping rapidly. The MC declared an inflight emergency, notified the Mishap Mission Safety Observer (MMSO), and turned the MQ-9A back towards the airfield. The mishap pilot (MP) declared his intention to move the MQ-9A to a position above the airfield (high key) which would provide the pilot more time to assess the situation and more opportunities to land the aircraft. <br/>Once the MMSO arrived in the Ground Control Station, he assessed the situation and recommended the MP not to go for high key but rather to head straight to the field for a straight-in approach. A straight-in approach is a quicker option to land the aircraft, but the pilot has only <br/>one opportunity to land the aircraft. The MP altered course to head for a straight-in approach, reasoning a high key approach may result in loss of life if he lost link with the MQ-9A. <br/>About 10 nautical miles from the airfield, the MQ-9A experienced un-commanded high torque, making it difficult for the MC to slow the drone. The MP subsequently shut down the engine. As the MQ-9A approached the runway, the MC assessed the altitude to be too high and the energy to be too fast for a successful landing. Therefore, the MP, at the direction of the MMSO, took two corrective actions. First, the MP slipped the aircraft, reducing the altitude. Second, the MP activated the flaps to slow the drone. The MQ-9A slowed, stalled, and crashed just short of the runway, within the fence line. It caught fire upon impact, and it was destroyed. <br/> <br/>The Abbreviated Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of the mishap was the MC¬ís deviation from preferred simulated flame out emergency procedures following an oil leak. In addition, the AAIB President determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, the MP¬ís lack of assertiveness was a substantially contributing factor in the mishap. <br/>",,,

For this reason, the drone could no longer determine its own position and initiated an emergency landing according to the internal logic of the Flight Termination System (FTS). This took place, as planned, by switching off the four engines and expelling the emergency parachute. <br/>Meteorological conditions or other external circumstances could be ruled out as the cause of the emergency landing. <br/>",,,

According to contemporary press reports... <br/> <br/>""A test flight of a ¬ìflying car¬î, designed for a proposed new ¬ìturbo-charged¬î sports league of flying cars called Airspeeder, went somewhat awry during Goodwood Festival of Speed yesterday. <br/> <br/>The motorsport concept, which is being created by Australian company Alauda Racing, suffered something of a setback after the test flight went dramatically out of control. <br/> <br/>The vehicles being designed for Airspeeder are variably described as ¬ëflying cars¬í or ¬ëelectric multicopters¬í, and will race head-to-head at speeds up to 250 km/h around racecourses in the sky. <br/> <br/>Alauda Racing founder and CEO Matt Pearson introduced the test flight to an invited audience of press in a venue on the Goodwood estate, adjacent to the Festival of Speed site. <br/> <br/>He explained: ¬ìWe¬íre developing our performance flying car as a new global sport. Since the age of 15, I¬íve wanted to build a flying race car and the technology now means it¬ís possible. We¬íve built a working ¬æ scale prototype of the flying race car and have just finished a 4-metre long Mk 4 concept model which I believe is the most exciting vehicle in the world.¬î <br/> <br/>Before launching the working prototype into the sky, Pearson admitted a test flight carried out in private the night before had crashed, and they¬íd rebuilt the car the night before and ¬ìcan¬ít promise a smooth landing.¬î <br/> <br/>Sadly, this ended up being quite a prophetic statement. The test flight at Goodwood started well, with the unmanned drone-like ¬ëcar¬í taking off successfully and sounding very much like a flying race car (see video clip below). It flew around for a minute or so at high-speeds until, suddenly, it hovered at standstill and began climbing into the air. It continued its climb until eventually it disappeared out of sight and out of earshot. <br/> <br/>With everyone ushered inside, the vehicle reappeared around 5-10 minutes later, where it dropped at some speed to the ground in a field nearby. <br/> <br/>Looking pretty unphased by the incident, Pearson promised ¬ìwe¬íll be back¬î as he went off to assess the damage.""",,,
