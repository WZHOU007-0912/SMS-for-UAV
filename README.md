- Data cleaning & removing unnecessary words.  
- Mishaps (UAV results) distribution

- Visualization on most common words of Contributing Factors/Situations for mishaps    
**We can see that human factor is the factor with highest frequency, illustrating which should be concerned with priority later in building the safety management system**   
**Besides, procedure (regulation, guidline), weather and airspace are also important factors in contributing the mishaps.**

- Visualization on Most Common Words in Primary Problem     
**Still, we can see that human factors, procedure and weather are the major factors when diving deeper into analysing the primary problems for UAV mishaps.**   
**Note that the chart, policy and equipment are also the significant factors we would consider in later fault tree analysis.**

- Visualization on Most Common Words in Human Factors     
**Further, let's explore the factors inside the human factors.**     
**We can see that situational awareness is the most common factor contributes to the mishaps.**  
**Communication breakdown, confusion, qualification, training, distraction, time pressure, workload and hunmanmachine interface are also the important factors in human error.**

- Visualization on Most Common Words in Narrative and Synopsis   
**Then look at the narrative and synopsis of the mishaps, 'runway', 'authorization', 'lost','control','radio','procedure','link','visual' are the high frequency words that may contain information we need.**

**The synopsis is indicating nearly the same information**

- Visualization on Most Common Words in Anomaly   
**The common words in anomaly illustrate that procedure deviation, published policy, airspace violation, excursion, loss control, turbulence, weather are the important factors in our later possible causes analysing.**

- Mishaps Occuring Time Distribution   
**We can see that most of mishaps occur between 0600 - 1800, which are the normal operating time of the flights.**

- Flight Phase Distribution in Mishap  
**69% of the mishaps occur in cruisung phase**

- Mishaps Detect Time  
**Most of mishaps are detected during in-flight phase and routine inspection.**

- Mishaps Occuring Light Condition Distribution   
**95% of mishaps fly/operate under Visual Meteorological Conditions while 86% are in daylight condition.**
